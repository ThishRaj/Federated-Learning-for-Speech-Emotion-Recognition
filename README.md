We have replicated the paper - [Federated learning for speech emotion recognition applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9111050) in this project.

## Speech Emotion Recognition Network
We train a Speech Emotion Recognition Network with the following architecture:

We use Federated Averaging algorithm to train the model in a decentralized fashion and aggregate the weights using

$w_{t+1} = \sum_{k \in S_t} \frac{n_k}{m_t} w^k_{t+1}$  

where $S_t$ is the set of all clients, $m_t$ is the number of samples in the $t$ th update, $n_k$ is the number of samples in the client during the $k$ round and $w^k_t$ is the weight update at the $t$ th update and $k$ th communication round.
